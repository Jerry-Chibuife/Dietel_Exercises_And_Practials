4.19 (Sales Commission Calculator) A large company pays its salespeople on a commission basis.
The salespeople receive $200 per week plus 9% of their gross sales for that week. For example, a
salesperson who sells $5,000 worth of merchandise in a week receives $200 plus 9% of $5,000, or
a total of $650. You’ve been supplied with a list of the items sold by each salesperson. The values of
these items are shown in Fig. 4.33. Develop a Java application that inputs one salesperson’s items
sold for last week and calculates and displays that salesperson’s earnings.
There’s no limit to the number of items that can be sold.
