package Chapter3.Exercise;// 3.14 (Clock Class) Create a class called Clock that includes three instance variables
//â€”an hour (type int), a minute (type int) and a second (type int). 
//Provide a constructor that initializes the three instance variables and 
//assumes that the values provided are correct. Provide a set and a get method for each instance variable. 
//The set method should set the value of all three variables to 0 if the value of hour is more than 23, 
//the value of minute is more than 59, and the value of second is more than 59. 
//Provide a method displayTime that display the time in an "hh:mm:ss" format.
//Write a test app named ClockTest that demonstrates class Clock's capabilities.
