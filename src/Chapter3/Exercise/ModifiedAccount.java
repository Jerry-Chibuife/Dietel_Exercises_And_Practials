package Chapter3.Exercise;/* 3.11 (Modified Account Class)
Modify class Account (Fig. 3.8) to provide a method called withdraw 
that withdraws money from an Account. 
Ensure that the withdrawal amount does not exceed the Accountâ€™s balance. 
If it does, the balance should be left unchanged and the method should print a message 
indicating "Withdrawal amount exceeded account balance." 
Modify class AccountTest (Fig. 3.9) to test method withdraw. */
