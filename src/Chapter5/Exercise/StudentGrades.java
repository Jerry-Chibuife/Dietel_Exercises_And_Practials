5.17 (Student Grades) A group of five students earned the following grades:
Student 1, ‘A’; student 2, C’; student 3, ‘B’; student 4, ‘A’ and student 5, ‘B’.
Write an application that reads a series of pairs of numbers as follows:
a) student name
b) student letter grade
Your program should use a switch statement to determine how many students got a grade of ‘A’,
how many got a grade of ‘B’, how many got a grade of ‘C’, and how many got a grade of ‘D’.
Use a loop as needed to input the five student grades, and then finally display the results.
